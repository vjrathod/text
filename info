<b>
ffmpeg uses autoconf as its build system. As of the time of this writing, no one has yet put together a Gradle build package for ffmpeg on Android. As far as I can tell, Gradle doesn't yet support autoconf, which makes it pretty difficult to do so
That said, after trying several of the tutorials that were out there, as well as some of the pre-built packages, we decided to roll our own Android build script wrapper for ffmpeg that includes support forOpenSSL and librtmp.

You can find it here: https://github.com/cine-io/android-ffmpeg-with-rtmp

Prerequisite: The Android NDK must be installed

Instructions:

$ git clone git@github.com:cine-io/android-ffmpeg-with-rtmp.git
$ cd android-ffmpeg-with-rtmp
$ ./build.sh

When the script is finished, the required shared libraries and ffmpeg executable will be put into the build/dist directory. You can include them in your project just like any other native binary.
